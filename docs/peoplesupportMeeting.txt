As of today, you've had about 110 days of bench time over the last 12 months and you know whilst you did receive 4 in your end of your review last year and you have been contributing to Techn.

Alan Canning 0 minutes 19 seconds
Ology across cloud but without a project it's it's very difficult as you know to demonstrate meeting expectations of of your role at manager level.

Alan Canning 0 minutes 28 seconds
And it could lead to receiving another forward end of your review.

Alan Canning 0 minutes 32 seconds
I this of course is very challenging for both CHIANOS and also for yourself in furthering your own career, and it's kind of unfair and holding you back from from furthering that. So as of today.

Alan Canning 0 minutes 46 seconds
It's unfortunately it is looking like you'll you'll be on the bench for this for the foreseeable future, potentially continuing into next year because those opportunities are forthcoming.

Alan Canning 0 minutes 55 seconds
So just to be clear, at this point we're not discussing termination or redundancy from K and OS. However, we do want to discuss the opportunity of supporting you in in seeking alternative employment outside of kainos.

Alan Canning 1 minute 7 seconds
So Carole is here to help you run, run through some options with you, but before.

Alan Canning 1 minute 13 seconds
Handing over to Carol, whilst I appreciate this conversation.

Alan Canning 1 minute 16 seconds
Not what you expected to have today, and it comes as a big shock to you.

Alan Canning 1 minute 19 seconds
Have any questions for us at this stage?

Abhay Mittal
1 minute 23 seconds
1:23
Abhay Mittal 1 minute 23 seconds
Yeah, it's been shocking.

Abhay Mittal 1 minute 25 seconds
Yeah, but I don't know how you're calculating the bench because I'm contributing a different projects.

Abhay Mittal 1 minute 31 seconds
I'm working with the presales.

Abhay Mittal 1 minute 33 seconds
Yeah, I submitted 2 RFI for the Northern Ireland.

Abhay Mittal 1 minute 38 seconds
Working different others I need to like repair but I'm very I know apart from the text explorer I'm doing other works as well like I'm working there to post some blog post on the canals as also on the.

Abhay Mittal 1 minute 55 seconds
Submit recently I did very small project with console and Dirham County Council and before that I will do the FPD and before that I am with the IBM.

Abhay Mittal 2 minutes 7 seconds
Yeah. So it is not full, I know, but it is very part because of the allocations. It is like 1/2 day location.

Abhay Mittal 2 minutes 14 seconds
So I need to book another half day into bench time.

Abhay Mittal 2 minutes 17 seconds
Yeah. So that's I'm.

=======
Yeah, look, and I I totally, essentially bench time. I'll pay is is if you're not full time engaged on a project.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 27 seconds
So I appreciate presales stalls count.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 29 seconds
You know, if you're on the bench and contributing to presales, you know that's that's great.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 34 seconds
The the crux of the matter is we, you know, over the last year, there's 110 days worth of us not being able to secure a project for your for yourself.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 43 seconds
So it's been very it's been very, very challenging and as as we look ahead towards the end of the year.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 50 seconds
And there's, you know, we we can't guarantee whether or not there's going to be.

Alan Canning 2 minutes 56 seconds
There's going to be an engagement for you, which you know, as I said, we we don't want to hold you back in terms of furthering your development in your career, but that that's the current lay of the land just at the moment.

=========

Carole Russell
3 minutes 10 seconds
3:10
Carole Russell 3 minutes 10 seconds
Sorry, I know this has been a shock and you weren't expecting it, but unfortunately we're looking right across the business.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 19 seconds
This is not just targeting you. We're looking at everyone to ensure that they're adding value in that there we have them working to 100% capacity and I think that's where obviously why we've had to have this conversation.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 35 seconds
I do apologise that it was a surprise to you.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 39 seconds
But when Alan explained that it's without prejudice conversation, what that means is we're not recording it.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 48 seconds
We're not, you know, equally.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 51 seconds
We don't give you permission to record it.

Carole Russell 3 minutes 53 seconds
It's an honest conversation where you can speak freely. Please, if you've got any questions or you've got any comments, we're here to try and help you.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 5 seconds
What we would rather do is try and help you as Alan's indicated.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 10 seconds
Further your career and give you the financial support to look outside rather than have a situation where we haven't been able to afford you the opportunity to address the things on year 4 rating and what we don't want to do is leave you in a position where again.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 31 seconds
At the end of the year, you would receive A4 rating.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 35 seconds
Because then we would be having different conversations and we do not look.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 40 seconds
Your reputation is that you're good.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 43 seconds
You work hard, but unfortunately the business hasn't come in to be able to utilize your skills, which is what we would have wanted.

Carole Russell 4 minutes 54 seconds
So in terms of what we would like you to do, we do not want you to make a decision now.

Carole Russell 5 minutes
I want you to go in. Think about it, please. But we would like to offer you a package to leave the company on mutual terms. And the benefit of that is I know he probably won't think it much of A benefit now, but you never say never.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 19 seconds
If you were to leave kaanos on mutual terms and an opportunity, or we got business in that needed someone of your skills, you could apply and come back into the business and you'd be welcomed because we've left on good terms.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 36 seconds
If, for example, someone.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 39 seconds
Had continued 4 ratings and they were performance managed and their services were terminated.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 44 seconds
They wouldn't be able to come back.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 46 seconds
That's why leaving on mutual terms and on good terms.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 51 seconds
Is why we like to do this.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 53 seconds
We don't do it for everyone.

Carole Russell 5 minutes 56 seconds
We are selective about who we do that for, but in terms of would you like to know what on offer, what we can give you in terms of those terms? Would you like me to go through that with you?

===========

Abhay Mittal
6 minutes 11 seconds
6:11
Abhay Mittal 6 minutes 11 seconds
Yeah, yeah, sure, definitely. Yeah.

Abhay Mittal 6 minutes 12 seconds
And and what about the other business opportunities here? I've lost data.

Abhay Mittal 6 minutes 17 seconds
I think opportunities of Workday considered that or not at all option.


=================

Carole Russell
6 minutes 22 seconds
6:22
Carole Russell 6 minutes 22 seconds
Well, we have got a large amount of people who are currently moving.

Carole Russell 6 minutes 29 seconds
Into Workday, and the vast majority of those people have actually applied, so it's unlikely.

Carole Russell 6 minutes 38 seconds
Look, it's very unlikely that will be anything else after they've looked at all the people that have applied.

Carole Russell 6 minutes 44 seconds
We are looking at now as the businesses service rather than DS, Workday. We're looking at it across those piece.

Carole Russell 6 minutes 52 seconds
And honestly, we haven't got the business. So we haven't got the business, whether it's in DS or in Workday to match your skills. If business comes in and it grows fantastic, we've got nothing in the pipeline. If we had a pipeline, we would be saying, right, let's wait.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 12 seconds
And see if that comes through.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 13 seconds
You know it's red, green or amber, but we've researched and we researched and there isn't anything.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 20 seconds
And as you see, the only other opportunities would be something that you could apply for.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 25 seconds
But in terms of Workday, I don't want to paint a bad picture, but it's unlikely.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 31 seconds
It's very unlikely.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 33 seconds
I'm not saying it's 100%, but I'm saying it's very slim. The chances.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 39 seconds
So.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 41 seconds
To talk, sort of.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 44 seconds
Crudely and basically, what is on offer?

Carole Russell 7 minutes 48 seconds
If you go away and obviously you need to look at your finances, you need to look at whether or not this is going to be acceptable to you.

Carole Russell 7 minutes 57 seconds
What we would be willing to do is, for example, what Alan's very clear about is he doesn't want force. He went to a decision today.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 6 seconds
He wants you to go and sleep on it or give a day or so.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 9 seconds
Then he come back and say you will consider it what it is is we would pay you.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 15 seconds
Excuse me, I'm going to have to cough.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 18 seconds
Excuse me.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 19 seconds
We would pay you till the end of the month without doing any work.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 26 seconds
If you wanted to do that.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 27 seconds
At the end of that you would receive a month's tax free.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 33 seconds
Plus three months notice, plus any outstanding annual leave that you have now.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 42 seconds
The reason that it's tax free is because the law says we can make a severance pay tax free, and you're probably in the 40% category of tax.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 54 seconds
I think you probably are.

Carole Russell 8 minutes 56 seconds
It's criminal, I know, but that means that it kind of equates to about.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 3 seconds
Five to six weeks.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 4 seconds
Are we because it's tax free?

Carole Russell 9 minutes 7 seconds
It won't be subject to any deductions, but the three months pay in lieu of notice has to be taxed because the law says it must be.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 16 seconds
And your outstanding annual leave has to be taxed as well. So you know, when you look at how much the overall package would be, it's giving you the financial cushion.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 29 seconds
Of a roundabout 5 months to secure another role.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 33 seconds
Well, you should still getting the income.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 36 seconds
So that's the offer that's on the table.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 41 seconds
In terms of, I don't know if you've ever gone through a mutual agreement before.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 46 seconds
If you haven't, basically what would happen is you would get an employment lawyer, but you wouldn't pay that.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 54 seconds
We will pay that Bill Kaanos pays the bill.

Carole Russell 9 minutes 59 seconds
On completion of signing the mutual agreement.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 2 seconds
It's not to negotiate or do anything like that, just to protect your legal rights.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 8 seconds
So we would drop a document if that's something you're interested in, we would send to you and your legal representative.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 17 seconds
They will advise you if your rates are being protected and once it's signed we will facilitate everything. All of the issues that you would have, you just need to reach out to me if you have any concerns. Now. I know we've said a lot in a very short.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 35 seconds
Time.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 37 seconds
So please, if you have any questions that come to mind now ask them if you have any questions after this call, please reach out to us because that's what we're here for.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 51 seconds
We're here to help and support you and I can honestly say that's why we're doing this.

Carole Russell 10 minutes 56 seconds
We want to support you to help you move on in a very positive way, not in a negative way. We don't want to go through addressing areas.

Carole Russell 11 minutes 7 seconds
We will, if we have to, but we don't want to.

Carole Russell 11 minutes 10 seconds
We want to help you so.

Carole Russell 11 minutes 13 seconds
Do you have any immediate questions that you'd like to ask us?

Carole Russell 11 minutes 45 seconds
We've been able, as I said, the whole month tax free plus your notice period plus any outstanding annual leave that you may have. Plus we would give you.

Carole Russell 11 minutes 58 seconds
To listen, I mean, we can pay you up until the end of September without you having to do any work.

Carole Russell 12 minutes 5 seconds
What the term is, is gardening.

Carole Russell 12 minutes 7 seconds
Leave. We can do that.

Carole Russell 12 minutes 9 seconds
That gives you time to sign the agreement.

Carole Russell 12 minutes 12 seconds
And really, you know, you're still employed within the business and then you would receive the four months after that one month tax free and three months which would be taxable.

Alan Canning 12 minutes 38 seconds
There's probably a lot to take in.
Alan Canning 12 minutes 41 seconds
And it's maybe a little grey in your mind, I suppose after this call.
Alan Canning 12 minutes 45 seconds
What we're saying here is go and have a think about it like Carole.
Alan Canning 12 minutes 50 seconds
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you if you would like this in writing so that you can spend some time looking at it and working it out, I'm sure Carol would be very happy to to send that over to you. Just so you can, you know, dig.
Alan Canning 13 minutes 2 seconds
It in your own time as opposed to on a call with us here now.
Alan Canning 13 minutes 6 seconds
So maybe that is an option you would prefer.

Carole Russell 13 minutes 27 seconds
So you know exactly what it is.
Carole Russell 13 minutes 30 seconds
You're getting. It will be in the agreement. The only thing I wanted to ask is, I know the medical cover that kanos provide is very good. If you have any current ongoing health issues that you're using, Bupa, I would be definitely willing to extend.
Carole Russell 13 minutes 50 seconds
Bupa cover till the end of the year as well, if that's something you feel you need.
Carole Russell 13 minutes 55 seconds
It's not something we do all of the time, but because of the fact that sometimes people are currently going through treatment or their families going through treatment, we would be willing to do that for you as well.

Carole Russell 14 minutes 30 seconds
And you know, I mean.
Carole Russell 14 minutes 33 seconds
I know it's it's a lot to think about. If I was sitting in your seat, I would be saying exactly what I'm saying to you is go away and think about it and then come back and let us know.
Carole Russell 14 minutes 46 seconds
I mean the marketplace is quite buoyant at the moment.
Carole Russell 14 minutes 50 seconds
Which we did look at, but unfortunately we haven't secured that business that we wanted to in order to fully utilise your expertise and that's you know regrettable for us all it really is.
Carole Russell 15 minutes 5 seconds

Alan Canning 16 minutes 30 seconds

Alan Canning 16 minutes 36 seconds
Is he still entitled to the package that we're offering him today?
CR
Carole Russell
16 minutes 38 seconds16:38

I can even give you a list of solicitors that you can choose. Which one?
Carole Russell 16 minutes 53 seconds
They will liaise there with you, but once that is signed, that money is yours and you don't have to wait to get another role. You can get a role whenever you want, but you will have the financial package and you will get the payment to you as soon.
Carole Russell 17 minutes 8 seconds
As possible the latest it will be is next payroll not this one next payroll.
Carole Russell 17 minutes 13 seconds
That will be the latest you will receive it.

So I'll be appreciate.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 23 seconds
It's a lot to take in.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 25 seconds
Certainly something that this is, you know, been very surprising to you.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 28 seconds
I I'm sure today and and we're not asking for you to make an immediate decision. Carl will send over the details.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 36 seconds
Have a look at it.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 38 seconds
And let us know within, you know, a day or two, you know, take take a bit of time to think it over after this call as well.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 45 seconds
You're more than welcome to reach out to Carol more than welcome to reach out to myself. Or if you feel more comfortable, have a chat with Roland.
Alan Canning 17 minutes 53 seconds
Who's your current people manager?
Alan Canning 17 minutes 56 seconds
And yeah, within the next couple of days, you can let us know how you'd like to proceed.
AM
Abhay Mittal
18 minutes 1 second18:01
Abhay Mittal 18 minutes 1 second
No, but this is only option.
Abhay Mittal 18 minutes 2 seconds
Yeah. So I don't know the other option.
Abhay Mittal 18 minutes 6 seconds
So what for me?

==========================

CR
Carole Russell
18 minutes 6 seconds18:06
Carole Russell 18 minutes 6 seconds
Well, the other.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 9 seconds
Unfortunately, the other option is to remain as you are and start addressing the key things that within your end of year weren't addressed.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 20 seconds
Now it's very difficult when the vast majority of time is on the bench, but it's difficult and it's very much micromanaging.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 31 seconds
But I have to be honest that that's the only other option.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 35 seconds
Because we can't let it continue.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 37 seconds
I am sorry, but that's.
Carole Russell 18 minutes 41 seconds
It it's best to be honest about it and I feel that being upfront and honest with you let you make the decision.

===============================
AM
Abhay Mittal
18 minutes 51 seconds18:51
Abhay Mittal 18 minutes 51 seconds
As well, the second option you're saying I can maybe because the review will happen in the in next end of review that is April or March.
CR
Carole Russell
18 minutes 51 seconds18:51
Carole Russell 18 minutes 51 seconds
OK.
AM
Abhay Mittal
19 minutes 2 seconds19:02
Abhay Mittal 19 minutes 2 seconds
But this can happen in the March.

=============================

CR
Carole Russell
19 minutes 3 seconds19:03
Carole Russell 19 minutes 3 seconds
If we were at, if we were addressing the areas, we would start a formal process and the formal process would mean if you're successful, fine. But if you're not here, services would be terminated.
Carole Russell 19 minutes 18 seconds
So it's just that's how it is.
Carole Russell 19 minutes 22 seconds
We're going through these things and we can do that and it, but it does put a lot of it, puts a lot of pressure on you.
Carole Russell 19 minutes 32 seconds
But it also puts a lot of pressure on your manager because they have to have weekly 'cause you have to provide weekly evidence throughout the period of time. If you succeed in achieving that, that's great.
Carole Russell 19 minutes 45 seconds
But what we also say is if there is any dip in any of those areas within the next six months, you would go straight back to the formal process, which would result in terminating of services.
Carole Russell 19 minutes 59 seconds
And you know within.
Carole Russell 20 minutes 1 second
Within the area you work.
Carole Russell 20 minutes 3 seconds
Reputation is very important and what we wouldn't want to do is damage your reputation, put you under any undue pressure.
Carole Russell 20 minutes 11 seconds
So This is why we've been able to make this generous offer to you today to try and avoid that.


=================================

AM
Abhay Mittal
20 minutes 22 seconds20:22
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 22 seconds
But I am already OK.
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 23 seconds
I need to have like a like send me the e-mail and then we think because I only have discussion with my people manager every two or three weeks and.
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 33 seconds
Working with him very closely after this four and or four, yeah.
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 38 seconds
So what is my difference anyway?
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 40 seconds
Send me e-mail.
Abhay Mittal 20 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah. And and definitely it will be the mostly the I will leave the company as soon as possible.

Than wonder and don't delay, ask me and then I can answer the questions for you. But I will send you the e-mail after this call. I have one more call to go on, but then I will send you the e-mail with the details and then if you decide.

That you would like to leave the business with the financial package.
Carole Russell 21 minutes 18 seconds
All you need to do is come back and tell me and tell me the name of a solicitor that you would like to use and then we can get that all drawn up for you, OK?
Carole Russell 21 minutes 30 seconds
Look, thank you for your time.
Carole Russell 21 minutes 34 seconds
I really can't thank you enough.
Carole Russell 21 minutes 35 seconds
I'm sorry that we're meeting for the first time under these circumstances, but unfortunately it's it's the business are making these decisions and regrettably a lot of people aren't been given the opportunity that you've been given, but you obviously have got a good reputation.
